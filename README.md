# PF2e Dancer Archetype

There are many types of mesmerising performances, from those channelled through the vocal cords to those channelled from the fingers. But perhaps the most captivating performers of all are masters of the dance, performing incredible feats of alacrity, flexibility, and athleticism that stun and surprise viewers. But dancing isn't only a brand of performance, it's a style of battle.

Able to flow from one move to the next without pause, a skilled dancer can overwhelm and surprise enemies with their unpredictable attacks and weave through danger with adaptable finesse. More than that, they can use the lightness they have on their feet and unparalleled flexibility to coordinate and manoeuvre wordlessly alongside their allies.



This archetype incorporates feats and abilities to use Dance in combat, and is based off an original idea and implementation which got then adjusted and readapted. The original can be found at https://scribe.pf2.tools/v/3jr91zr0-archetypes
